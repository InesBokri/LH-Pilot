Technical Assessment for iOS Software Engineers in Pilot Apps Team done by Ines BOKRI (ines.bokri.belgacem@gmail.com)

I chose to build this mini application using UIKit with MVVM as the architecture.
I didn't use any external library.
This app run in the iOS Simulator and it works both on iPhone and iPad.
I created two views: RegistrationView and ConfirmationView.
